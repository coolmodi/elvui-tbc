# Modified ElvUI TBC
Original can be found here: https://git.tukui.org/elvui/elvui-tbc

## Changes
* Heal prediction only shows heal happening in the next 3 seconds, which is usually direct heals and one tick from HoTs. Timeframe can be changed per unitframe in the respective Heal Prediction settings.
* Heal prediction bars show if other people will heal before you for up to 2 direct heals. HoTs are always shown last. Should be enough to decide whether to cancel or not most of the time.
* Added tags that show predicted HP after incoming heals (see Available Tags -> Health in ElvUI settings).
* Custom healthbar color for charmed units, can be toggled for each unitframe type in the respective Health category.
* Added heal prediction to target of target frame.
